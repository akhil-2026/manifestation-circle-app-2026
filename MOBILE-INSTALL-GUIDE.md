## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Installation Option Doesn't Appear:

#### For Android:
1. **Clear Chrome cache**: Settings → Apps → Chrome → Storage → Clear Cache
2. **Check Chrome version**: Update to latest version
3. **Try incognito mode**: Open link in incognito tab
4. **Wait longer**: Some devices need 60+ seconds before showing prompt

#### For iPhone:
1. **Use Safari only**: Chrome/Firefox won't show install option on iOS
2. **Update Safari**: Make sure iOS is updated
3. **Clear Safari cache**: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
4. **Try again**: Sometimes takes multiple attempts

### Still Not Working?

#### Check These Requirements:
1. **Internet connection**: Must be online for first install
2. **Storage space**: Need at least 50MB free space
3. **Browser permissions**: Allow notifications if prompted
4. **HTTPS**: The site must load with a lock icon (secure)

#### Alternative Method:
If automatic installation fails, you can still use the app:
1. Open the website in your browser
2. Bookmark it for easy access
3. It will work like a regular web app
